- 👋 Hi, I’m @edujosantu
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge on data science in both a professional and personal way. After beginning my Master's of Information Management at KULeuven, I was able to meeet amazing people with different backgrounds that opened my eyes to knowledge I had previously ignored. I had the opportunity to work with an amazing colleague on a data visualization project on Van Gogh, using a among other resources, some publications found in GitHub. After this, my interest on how many things can be done was ignited, and I also became aware of the lack of skills I have (even though I do have some other skills which complemented the ones my colleagues didn't have).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Now, this is an issue. I do not know where to begin, what to learn, so I am currently deciding on what to do. But I have finally created my own GitHub account, being aware of how important it is to have a portfolio of the projects and endevours one has ventured in, as a platform for professional "recognition" and meeting likeminded people with whom I could collaborate with.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the same data visualization project mentioned above. I want to explore the opportunity to see if I can do the same project (for which I have no source code or anything, just the main idea of which database I used and how to approach the "problem") and see if I can start learning and practicing coding knowledge and achieve in some way the same visualizations or something new.
- 📫 How to reach me: for now, GitHub.
